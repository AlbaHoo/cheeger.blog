# What to do:
`ssh user@hostname` requires typing password each time which can be annoying. Using SSH Key-Based Authentication is an alternative.

# Step1:
In you local computer, generate a key pair

    ssh-kengen

you will see:

    Generating public/private rsa key pair.
    Enter file in which to save the key (/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa):

You can save to another directory if you want, but it's not recommended. It will then generate a `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`, the private and public key pair.

It then will prompt options for you to configure, won't go wrong, but you would better leave the `pass-phase` blank, otherwise you will have to type extra password to using this key pair for ssh authentication.


# STEP2:
Copy the `id_rsa.pub` to the server.

    ssh-copy-id use@remote_host

This will copy the contents of `id_rsa.pub` into a file called `.ssh/authorized_keys` in the remote user's home directory.a

If you don't have `ssh-copy-id` in you local, you can simple copy over or use `scp`, e.g.

    scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@remote_host:~/.ssh/authorized_keys


# STEP3:

Then you will be able to ssh to remote host by:

    ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa user@remote_host

to make it even more simpler:

    vim ~/.ssh/config

Add these lines to it:

{% highlight ruby %}
Host my_remote_server
    User user
    HostName ip4
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github_key
{% endhighlight %}
Then you can just do `ssh my_remote_server`.
